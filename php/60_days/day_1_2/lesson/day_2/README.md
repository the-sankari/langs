# PHP Learning Journey Lesson: Day 2 - Basic Syntax and Variables

Welcome to Day 2 of your PHP learning journey! Today, we'll delve deeper into PHP syntax and variables, building upon what we learned yesterday.

## Goals:
By the end of today's lesson, you'll:
- Understand the basic rules of PHP syntax.
- Learn how to declare variables in PHP and the different types of data they can hold.
- Practice performing simple arithmetic operations with PHP variables.

## 1. Understanding PHP Syntax:
In PHP, syntax refers to the rules that dictate how code should be written. Here are some key points to remember:

- PHP code is enclosed within `<?php` and `?>` tags. Anything outside these tags is treated as HTML.
- Statements in PHP should end with a semicolon (`;`). This tells PHP where one statement ends and another begins.
- PHP variable names start with a dollar sign (`$`) followed by the variable name. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but they cannot start with a number.
- Comments in PHP are used to make notes within the code. Single-line comments start with `//`, and multi-line comments are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`.

## 2. Variables and Data Types:
Variables in PHP are used to store data values. Here's how you declare variables:

```php
$variable_name = value;
````
In PHP, variables can hold different types of data, including:

    Strings: Text enclosed in single or double quotes (e.g., "Hello" or 'World').
    Integers: Whole numbers without decimal points (e.g., 10).
    Floats (or floating-point numbers): Numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14).
    Booleans: True or false values (true or false).

3. Basic Operations:

PHP allows you to perform arithmetic operations with variables. Here are some common arithmetic operators:

    Addition (+): Adds two values together.
    Subtraction (-): Subtracts one value from another.
    Multiplication (*): Multiplies two values.
    Division (/): Divides one value by another.
    Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division operation.

For example:
```php
$x = 10;
$y = 5;
$sum = $x + $y; // $sum will be 15
```
Next Steps:

Now that you understand the basic syntax of PHP and how to work with variables, it's time to practice! Experiment with declaring variables, assigning values, and performing arithmetic operations. In the next lesson, we'll explore control structures and functions in PHP.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
